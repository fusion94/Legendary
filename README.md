Who is Barney Stinson? 

* He is a womanizer, favors suits, laser tag, and uses the words "awesome" and "legendary" frequently.
* Barney is almost always seen wearing a suit and makes great use of his catchphrase, "Suit up!", often modifying it for a particular situation (i.e., "Snowsuit up!" while making an igloo in Central Park, or "Flight suit up!" when he dresses as a "kick a** fighter pilot" for Halloween, or "Slut Up!" when Lily and Robin get ready to go to a high school prom, or when he says "Space suit up Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon," in the episode where Ted may or may not have a threesome).
